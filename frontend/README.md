# AI Housekeeping Advisor Bot - Frontend

This is the frontend application for the AI Housekeeping Advisor Bot. It allows users to upload images of their home environment and receive practical housekeeping advice generated by AI.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dmasubuchi/SimpleReactCam.git
   cd SimpleReactCam/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Mock API Implementation

This frontend includes a mock API implementation that allows you to test the application without deploying the backend to GCP. The mock API simulates responses for the following scenarios:

- Plant care advice
- Closet organization advice
- Refrigerator organization advice

### How to Use Mock API

The application automatically uses the mock API implementation when:

1. The `.env.development` file is used (development mode)
2. The `VITE_API_URL` environment variable is set to `mock`
3. The `VITE_API_URL` is not set or contains the placeholder value

To explicitly use the mock API, create or modify the `.env.development` file:

```
VITE_API_URL=mock
```

### Testing with Real Backend

To test with the real backend API, update the `.env.development` file with the actual API Gateway URL:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-gateway-url
```

## Deployment

### Building for Production

1. Update the `.env.production` file with your API Gateway URL:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-gateway-url
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. The build output will be in the `dist` directory, which can be deployed to any static hosting service.

## Available Scripts
